# webtest-call

Have you ever thought of developing and debugging your selenium code?
If yes, then all you need is the latest release of this repository.
You can debug your code using CLI operations of this jar.

## But why I need this... ?
Traditional way of writing selenium codes:
- Contains maximum locator errors
- Visibility of element checks during runtime
- Application is behaving differently during script execution

Well, all these problems can be solved if I parallely test 
locators along with automation scripting. Once you run your test, no errors
can stop you from ZERO script related errors.

## Tell me how to use this ?
This is pretty simple for you. Just download the latest <b>webtest-call.jar<b> file
